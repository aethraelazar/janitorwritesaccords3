        <p>
            The Trump Accord stands as a testament to bold, unapologetic leadership and practical vision. This accord seeks to preserve life, restore balance, and ensure a future where sovereignty and peace are not at odds, but in harmony.
        </p>
        <p>
            With strength, transparency, and righteous resolve, we propose this initiative to safeguard not only our generation but those yet unborn. From energy independence to international respect, the principles of the Trump Accord shall defend the dignity of nations and the prosperity of people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let this be the foundation stone of a new diplomacy — one that is fierce in defense, but generous in peace. We ask for nothing in return, only that righteousness guide every signature henceforth.
